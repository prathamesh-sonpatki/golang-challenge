#### The May 2015 Go Challenge for developers (newbies included)

#### Sau Sheong Chang: Author of the third Go Challenge

<img align="right" src="/images/sausheong.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Sau Sheong Chang" title="Sau Sheong Chang" style="border:5px solid black" />
The third Go Challenge author is [Sau Sheong Chang](https://twitter.com/sausheong). He has been doing software development for 20 years, mostly in web application development. He is active in the Ruby and Go developer communities and has contributed to open source projects and spoke at meetups and conferences. Sau Sheong has also published 3 programming-related books, mostly on Ruby and is working on a 4th book titled [Go Web Programming](https://github.com/golangchallenge/gc3/blob/master/manning.com/chang). He is currently a Director of Global Consumer Engineering in PayPal, based out of sunny Singapore and has in his career worked for HP, Yahoo, and also ran a technology startup during the dot-com days.

Sau has this to say about the challenge:

> "This is a challenge for beginners to start learning about writing web applications in Go. Generating photo-mosaics is the fun bit. After the challenge, the challenge participant should be able to write a web application, write test cases, authenticate users, call REST-based API and at the very least, manipulate images all using the standard Go library."

> "And of course, have lots of fun in the process."

#### Challenge Rules and how to enter the Go Challenge?

By participating in this challenge, you agree to be bound by the Challenge Rules below:

* The Challenge is open to individuals.
* Evaluators cannot enter the challenge except under the "Just for Fun" category.
* Each entrant shall indemnify, defend, and hold JoshSoftware Pvt. Ltd. (who has sponsored the domain and is the organizer of these challenges) harmless from any third party claims arising from or related to that entrant's participation in the Challenge. In no event shall JoshSoftware Pvt. Ltd. be liable to an entrant for acts or omissions arising out of or related to the Challenge or that entrant's participation in the Challenge.
* Odds of winning depend on the number and quality of entries received. 
* All taxes, including income taxes, are the sole responsibility of the winners. 
* No prize substitution is permitted.
* Do [organize your code](https://youtu.be/XCsL89YtqCs).
* You need to write test cases for the main flow. You can use a useful tool `goconvey` - use its UI without using their DSL. GoConvey supports Go's native testing package.
* Create a zip of your Go source code and test cases and send the zip file to **golangchallenge [at] gmail.com before 18th of May 2015 (6 am IST). Use [this link](http://www.worldtimeserver.com/convert_time_in_IN.aspx?y=2015&mo=5&d=18&h=6&mn=0) to find the equivalent time in your city/country**. No new solutions will be accepted after that. In the email mention **your full name, country of residence, twitter or GitHub id (if any) and participating under which category - Just participating | Participating and exploring further | Just for Fun | Anonymous entry**. We are accepting anonymous submissions and will evaluate them too but then these participants are not eligible for the prizes. 
* We will give your zip file to the evaluation team. 
* We shall be publishing on this blog, a list of participant names. If you don't want your name to appear kindly mention the same in your email. 
* You are allowed to re-submit your code if you feel it is necessary.
* **Note**: Avoid sharing your code with anyone else; if your solution becomes available to the general public it might impact evaluation of your submission.
* After the challenge is over, all submissions will be made available [online on GitHub](https://github.com/golangchallenge/GCSolutions) under the [BSD 3-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) or the [GNU General Public License, version 3 - GPL-3.0](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0) unless a participant has indicated that his/her solution should not be made public before the challenge ends.

#### How will the challenge be evaluated?

Entries will be anonymized and evaluated by the challenge author and a team of evaluators.

* Functioning code and a test suite that passes.
* Code hygiene. Use [gofmt](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/), [vet](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/vet) and [lint](https://github.com/golang/lint). Review [CodeReviewComments](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
* Readability. How easy is it for another programmer to grasp what your entry is doing?
* Code structure. Do types and files have good names?
* Reliability. Are errors properly handled?
* Appropriate consideration given to memory and performance (nothing is unnecessarily expensive).

#### Questions?

If you have any questions about this challenge, please join the [golang-challenge channel on slack](http://t.co/n6EesY9Mmv) and ask your questions. This is a room for people who are going to participate in the Go Challenge. You can also send us an email at golangchallenge [at] gmail.com
