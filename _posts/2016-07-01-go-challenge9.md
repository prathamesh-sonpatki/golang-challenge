#### The Go Challenge 9

##### Nothin' But a Go Thang

##### Preamble

I grew up with Hip Hop. It connected me with a culture that seemed very alien, having grown up in the suburb of a suburb in Northwestern USA. Hip Hop changed dramatically over the years but one thing that stayed constant was story telling.

Here are some samples of some of my favorites over the decades starting from my youth to the present.

80s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2TN-kDEKxF0">Eric B. & Rakim - I Ain't No Joke</a>

90s <a href="https://youtu.be/_JZom_gVfuw">The Notorious B.I.G. - "Juicy"</a>

00s <a href="https://youtu.be/UVtpXvzzXiA">Talib Kweli - Get By</a>

10s <a href="https://youtu.be/R3ib9gCw1F4">Open Mike Eagle - Ziggy Starfish</a>

It has always been one of my dreams to be a rapper. Unfortunately I spend way too much time on Twitter. I don’t have nearly the amount of time and energy necessary to write rhymes and practice my flow.

**The Goal of the challenge**

The goal of this challenge is to create a tweet to rap converter. It will take a twitter user as input and return rap versions of the tweets in their timeline.

**Requirements of the challenge**

For example, let’s take Brad Fitz tweet:

> I've never used Plan 9, but I watch it install occasionally.
> And today I learned that "myriad" can mean 4. <a href="pic.twitter.com/sIkvgEBMEF">pic.twitter.com/sIkvgEBMEF</a>
>
> — Brad Fitzpatrick (@bradfitz) <a href="https://twitter.com/bradfitz/status/729875418837196800">May 10, 2016</a>

One possible output could be...

Leave you, I never mean to<br />I watch it occasionally<br />Today I learned what I’m about to do

Or from Mr. Cheney:

> Companies that reject remote working are implicitly putting their own internal communication problems above hiring the best candidate.
>
> — Dαve Cheney (@davecheney) <a href="https://twitter.com/davecheney/status/599404180483284993">May 16, 2015</a>

Could be...

Workin’ with the work, plus you know I keep the strap!<br />Problem is communication just be between me and myself<br />back to the snap

**Features**:

* Tweets are 140 characters or less
* two lines need to rhyme
* it feels as much as possible like the original tweet

**Hint**

* Take a look at the Soundex and Metaphone algorithms

**Bonus features**:

* keep a nice meter
* complex rhyming scheme (ex. multi-sylable rhymes)
* classic hip hop lyrics mixed in
